## About This Repo

This is my personal Python learning journal from the Masterschool Data Analytics program. It includes hands-on exercises, assessments, and practice notebooks organized by sprint. Each notebook reflects a different stage in my learning journey.

## Intro to Python

### Sprint 1: Python Basics

Gain a solid understanding of Python basics, such as:

- **Data Types:** Strings, integers, floats, and booleans.
- **Variables:** Storing and manipulating data.
- **Arithmetic Operators:** Performing calculations.
- **Conditions:** Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to make decisions.
- **Functions:** Writing reusable blocks of code.
