## About This Repo

This is my personal Python learning journal from the Masterschool Data Analytics program. It includes hands-on exercises, assessments, and practice notebooks organized by sprint. Each notebook reflects a different stage in my learning journey.

## Intro to Python

### Sprint 1: Python Basics

Gain a solid understanding of Python basics, such as:

- **Data Types:** Strings, integers, floats, and booleans.
- **Variables:** Storing and manipulating data.
- **Arithmetic Operators:** Performing calculations.
- **Conditions:** Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to make decisions.
- **Functions:** Writing reusable blocks of code.

### Sprint 2: Intermediate Python

Learn how to handle real-world data challenges by diving deeper into Pythonâ€™s powerful features:

- **Strings:** Manipulating and formatting text.
- **Booleans:** Working with `True` and `False` values.
- **Lists:** Storing and managing collections of data.
- **Loops:** Automating repetitive tasks with `for` and `while` loops.
- **Dictionaries:** Storing data in key-value pairs.
- **Tuples and Sets:** Working with immutable and unique collections.
